  <h1> My Profile </h1>
  <h2><u> Personal Information </u></h2>
  <p>I am Wai Yan Htike, but many know me as William. I am an international student and I lived in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Since I am from Myanmar, my first language is Burmese. I have been speaking and learning English as long as I can remember and I am fluent in it. As of right now, I only speak two languages, but I am trying to learn Spanish. I have done IGCESE O Level and finished RMIT Foundation in 2019. I attended my first year in RMIT University last year but COVID came in and I had to take leave. Now, I am back at my study in RMIT University. I have a strong hobby in photography, but I cannot afford expensive cameras. So, I use my phone and posted photos on my Instagram.</p>
